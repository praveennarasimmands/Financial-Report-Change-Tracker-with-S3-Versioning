# **Financial Report Change Tracker with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Financial Services

### **Problem Statement**
Financial reports are frequently updated for compliance, auditing, and internal decision-making purposes. Without a proper version control system, changes may be missed or overlooked, potentially leading to errors or non-compliance with regulations.

### **Challenges**
- **Difficulty in Tracking Changes**: Financial reports are often revised or updated, and tracking these changes without a proper versioning system can lead to inconsistencies.
- **Risk of Errors**: Missing or incorrect revisions in reports could result in errors during audits or financial reviews.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Financial revisions need to be fully traceable to ensure transparency, especially during audits or when meeting regulatory requirements.

### **Solution Overview**
The **Financial Report Change Tracker** uses **S3 Versioning** to track and store revisions of financial reports, ensuring that every change is preserved for auditing and compliance purposes. This solution improves transparency and reduces the risk of errors or missed revisions.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
S3 Versioning allows organizations to maintain a complete version history of financial reports, enabling auditors and internal teams to track every change, compare revisions, and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: Financial report files are stored in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled to automatically track all changes and revisions.
2. **Create an Interface for Comparing Versions**: Build a user-friendly interface to compare financial reports, highlight changes, and provide easy access to historical versions.
3. **Implement Security Controls**: Ensure that access to financial data is controlled and compliant with industry standards and regulations.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Financial Reports**: Automatically tracks all revisions and changes made to financial reports, ensuring a complete history.
- **Audit History and Metadata**: Each revision is tagged with metadata such as the date, author, and a detailed history of changes.
- **Comparison Tool for Report Changes**: An interface that allows users to visually compare versions of financial reports to quickly identify differences.
- **Secure Storage**: Store all versions of financial reports securely in an S3 bucket with access controls.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Financial Reports in S3**: Financial reports are uploaded to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, ensuring every change is automatically tracked.
2. **Track Updates and Revisions**: Every time a report is updated, S3 Versioning automatically stores a new version, keeping a detailed history of changes.
3. **Review and Compare Versions**: Users can access a web interface to compare versions, view metadata, and ensure all necessary revisions have been captured.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up S3 Versioning**
Enable versioning on the S3 bucket used to store financial reports with the `enable_versioning.py` script.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 2: Upload Financial Reports**
Financial reports are uploaded to the S3 bucket using the `upload_report.py` script, ensuring that every update is tracked as a new version.

```bash
python upload_report.py
```

### **Step 3: List Versions**
Users can view a list of all available versions of a financial report with the `list_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 4: Compare Report Versions**
Use the `compare_reports.py` script to visually compare different versions of a financial report and identify the changes made.

```bash
python compare_reports.py
```
